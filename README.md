Scrap Mechanic Password Session Locker (smpwd)

Locks your session under a password, so that even Steam friends are unable to join without also having the correct password.

## Details for Nerds
By default, SM multiplayer sessions are checked for file hash integrity when joining. It's meant to be a security feature, but can be repurposed here to enforce that someone has to provide a password before they can join.
